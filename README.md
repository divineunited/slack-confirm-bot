## Running the Bot

```

## Testing End-to-End with Slack

### 1. Verify Bot is Online

After starting the bot, check your Slack workspace. The bot should appear as online.

### 2. Test Slash Command

In any channel where the bot is present, try:
```
/read-confirm @username This is a test announcement
```

The bot should:
1. Post the message "This is a test announcement"
2. Send you a confirmation that the announcement was created
3. Create entries in your database

### 3. Test Mention Command

In any channel where the bot is present, try:
```
@read-confirm-bot read-confirm This is another test announcement
```

The bot should:
1. Post the message "This is another test announcement"
2. Send a confirmation message
3. Create entries in your database

### 4. Test Read Confirmation

1. Add a âœ… reaction to one of the test announcements
2. Check your database to verify a read receipt was created:
   ```
   psql postgresql://localhost:5432/slack_read_confirm
   SELECT * FROM read_receipts;
   ```

### 5. Verify Database Records

After testing, check your database to see all created records:

```
psql postgresql://localhost:5432/slack_read_confirm

-- View all announcements
SELECT * FROM announcements;

-- View all targets
SELECT * FROM targets;

-- View all read receipts
SELECT * FROM read_receipts;

-- View read status for a specific announcement
SELECT a.text, t.user_id, 
  CASE WHEN r.id IS NULL THEN 'Not Read' ELSE 'Read' END as status
FROM announcements a
JOIN targets t ON a.id = t.announcement_id
LEFT JOIN read_receipts r ON t.id = r.target_id
WHERE a.id = 1;  -- Replace with your announcement ID
```

## Troubleshooting

### Bot Not Responding
- Check that both `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` and `SLACK_APP_TOKEN` are correctly set in your `.env` file
- Verify the bot is running without errors
- Ensure all required scopes are added to your Slack app

### Database Issues
- Run `python -m slack_read_confirm.db_test` to verify database connectivity
- Check PostgreSQL is running with `pg_isready -h localhost -p 5432`
- Ensure the database exists with `psql -l | grep slack_read_confirm`

### Event Handling Issues
- Make sure Socket Mode is enabled in your Slack app
- Verify you've subscribed to the required bot events
- Check the console output for any error messages
